# parallel-computing

**Course Description:** The purpose of this course is to learn the fundamentals of parallel programming and develop those skills by writing parallel programs. To that end, both the design philosophy behind parallel architectures and parallel software will be discussed in the context of a variety of applications, programming styles, and architectures.

**Learning Outcomes:** At the completion of the course, you will be able to: 
1. Develop parallel applications for shared-memory systems, distributed systems, as well as GPUs
2. Evaluate the properties of parallel architectures. 
3. Understand the main principles of parallel algorithm design4.Use multiple programming models and methods5.Model and analyze parallel programs and systems
